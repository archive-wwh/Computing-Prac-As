practical notes for h2 computing

DISCLAIMER:
all code seen is what i recommend as someone who struggles to remember the syntax due to my lack of coding background before jc 
follow your own style/ what you are most comfortable with as some codes may not be the most efficient 

understand the theory dictating the codes first before going into practical
theory notes can be found at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bu_XklONOn_zrGFHQs3NaXvkE1ewPIB7as1JK6ZLh5o/edit?usp=sharing
